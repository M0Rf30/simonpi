# SimOnPI

![simonpi-logo](./images/logo.png)

## Description

A quick & dirty script to emulate Raspberry family devices on your laptop.
It generates a valid sdcard image that can be deployed on real hardware and used as virtual storage for QEMU.

### Some features

- Preliminary support for custom images generated by third parties, adopting the classic Raspberry Pi partition table.
- Use OVMF UEFI images for rpi-2, rpi-3 & rpi-4
- Almost full KVM acceleration for aarch64
- Latest stable Linux kernels for every supported platform
- Basic Networking support
- Docker image and example docker-compose file for quick deploy
- SSH guest access

Powered with :heart: by Arch Linux Arm images

## Instructions

### Required runtime dependencies

- coreutils
- dnsmasq
- dosfstools
- e2fsprogs
- file
- grep
- iproute2
- iptables
- libarchive
- procps-ng
- qemu-arch-extra
- sudo
- util-linux
- curl

### From sources

1. Download the sources and go into the simonpi directory

   `git clone https://github.com/M0Rf30/simonpi.git`

   `cd simonpi`

2. Set permissions for QEMU bridge interface

   `sudo echo "allow rasp-br0 >> /etc/qemu/bridge.conf`

3. Download the required EDK2-AVMF images:

   and place them respectively in the follow path:

   /usr/share/edk2-armvirt/aarch64/QEMU_EFI.fd

4. Type:

   `./simonpi -h for details`

and follow the help guidelines

### For Arch Linux users

You can find sim-on-pi on AUR

Type:

`yaourt -S simonpi`

or

`yaourt -S simonpi-git`

for latest development changes

and that's all!

### Docker image

See the **How to** into **docker** folder

## Deployment

All the assets (disk images, downloaded archives..) are saved in
`~/.simonpi` by default.

You can transfer your sd img on a valid sdcard using programs like Etcher or this simple command:

`dd if=sd-arch-MODEL-qemu.img of=/dev/sdX bs=4M`

where MODEL could be:

- rpi
- rpi-2
- rpi-3
- rpi-4 and theorically next upgrades
  and X could be mmcblk0 or other block devices
